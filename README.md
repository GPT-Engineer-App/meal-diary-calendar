# meal-diary-calendar

I want a simple mobile and tablet friendly web application that lets me journal my food eaten per day. 

-Start with a calendar view of the current month 
-Default to the current day highlighted 
-Let you click on a day to open up that day
-Let you pick on a meal: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack 
-Let you type in what you ate. Just the food, nothing else. Save it to the database -

then you can: 
-view summaries of what you ate on a weekly and monthly basis
